# How-to Guide
1. Use git and optionally, an external website to push to
Leam how to use git and commit early and often. Optionally use a web-site such as GitHub to push your work to. Build a portfolio.
t Understand the problem
Leam how to perform your own research. It's an incredibly useful skill which can be applied to anything in life. If you find the problem difficult, don't give up, break it down. Draw it out, write it out, do whatever you need to do to solve it.
If the problem you are facing is too easy, do a brain storm and add addi¬tional functionality and/or combine it with other ideas to make your soft¬ware more challenging.
2.	Implementation
Take the language you are most familiar with to start your project off. However, if the problem is too easy, pick a language you have never used. Don't be afraid to write awful code and don't worry about the best implementation. Get it written up first and then refactor, dean it up and so on.
3.	Test
Write test cases up for your program. If you prefer paper then use paper, if you prefer Microsoft word, use that, but get used to thinking about how you can break your software. Find problems, bugs and fix them. Repeat it over and over again and document it. Throw it together into your portfolio. Remember, commit often. If something goes wrong, revert back.
4.	Reimplement
Now that you have something together with lots of documentation and experience; go wild! Use a different language and try to match it as much as possible to your first implementation. Add features, try new techniques, idioms. Try to refactor your code and optimise it
5.	Don't stop learning Now you have gotten this far, don't stop trying to challenge yourself. Keep a portfolio, keep a blog and keep adding to it. It will look fantastic to potential employers.
6.	Resources Wikipedia, Stack Overflow and Google.
Seriously this is all you will ever need. If you aren't getting results, you are not doing your research properly and you need to improve this. I can not state enough how important this skill is and it isn't hard. With these three websites, you find your answers and if it doesn't exist, make a thread on Stack Overflow and by doing so you help other people out too.
Remember, if you make a new topic for a new problem anywhere, write down what the solution is if somebody private messaged you. It helps people out a lot and it will encourage them to do the same!
7.	Literature
Knuth: The Art of Computer Programming
Skiena: The Algorithm Design Manual
Cormen et al: Introduction to Algorithms
Rusell, Norvig: Artificial Inteligence: A Modem Approach
Abelson, Sussman: Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs
8.	More challenges?
